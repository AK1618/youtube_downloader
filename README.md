# YouTube Video Downloader (Pytube)

This project provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for downloading YouTube videos using the Pytube library. Pytube is a powerful library that allows users to interact with the YouTube website and download videos directly to their local machines.

Limitations of Pytube Library:
1. Restricted Video Availability: Pytube relies on the YouTube Data API to retrieve video information and download video streams. However, if a video is set as private, restricted, or blocked in certain countries, Pytube may not be able to download it due to YouTube's policies and access restrictions.
2. YouTube Policy Changes: YouTube periodically updates its website structure and policies, which may cause compatibility issues with Pytube. Users should be aware that significant changes on YouTube's end can temporarily or permanently disrupt Pytube's functionality until the library is updated to accommodate these changes.
3. Video Format and Quality Limitations: Pytube provides access to various video formats and qualities available for a given video. However, the availability of formats and qualities may vary depending on the video itself. Some videos may not have high-resolution options or certain formats accessible for download.
4. Captions and Subtitles: Pytube focuses primarily on video downloading and may not provide extensive support for downloading captions or subtitles associated with the videos. Users may need to explore other solutions to obtain captions or subtitles separately.
5. Performance and Stability: Pytube's performance and stability can be influenced by factors such as network connectivity, YouTube server status, and the library's own implementation. Slow network connections or issues with YouTube servers can affect the download speed and reliability of Pytube.
6. Legal Considerations: Downloading YouTube videos using Pytube may infringe on YouTube's terms of service or violate copyright laws. Users should ensure that they have the necessary permissions or rights to download videos and respect intellectual property rights.

Conclusion
While Pytube is a popular library for downloading YouTube videos, users should be aware of its limitations and manage their expectations accordingly. It is essential to stay updated with the latest version of Pytube and use the library responsibly, adhering to legal and ethical guidelines when downloading videos.
For any issues or limitations not covered in this README, users can refer to the Pytube documentation, GitHub repository, or seek assistance from the Pytube community for further guidance.
