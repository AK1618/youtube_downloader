This project provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for downloading YouTube videos using the Pytube library. The Pytube library allows you to interact with the YouTube website and provides functionality for downloading videos. However, it has certain limitations that you should be aware of. This README file will outline these limitations to help you understand the constraints of using the Pytube library for video downloads.

Limitations of Pytube Library:

Restricted video availability: Pytube relies on the YouTube Data API to retrieve video information and download video streams. If a video is set as private, restricted, or blocked in certain countries, Pytube may not be able to download it. The availability of videos is determined by YouTube's policies and access restrictions.

YouTube policy changes: YouTube periodically updates its website structure and policies, which may cause compatibility issues with Pytube. If YouTube introduces significant changes that affect the way video information or download streams are retrieved, it may temporarily or permanently disrupt Pytube's functionality until the library is updated to accommodate these changes.

Video format and quality limitations: Pytube provides access to various video formats and qualities available for a given video. However, the availability of formats and qualities may vary depending on the video itself. Some videos may not have high-resolution options or certain formats accessible for download. The availability of formats and qualities is determined by YouTube.

Captions and subtitles: Pytube focuses primarily on video downloading and may not provide extensive support for downloading captions or subtitles associated with the videos. While it may be possible to obtain captions or subtitles separately, Pytube's main functionality revolves around video downloads.

Performance and stability: Pytube's performance and stability may be influenced by factors such as network connectivity, YouTube server status, and the library's own implementation. Slow network connections or issues with YouTube servers can affect the download speed and reliability of Pytube. Additionally, since Pytube is an open-source library, occasional bugs or errors may arise.

Legal considerations: It's important to note that downloading YouTube videos may infringe on YouTube's terms of service or violate copyright laws. Before downloading any video, ensure that you have the necessary permissions or rights to do so. Respect intellectual property rights and use the Pytube library responsibly.

Conclusion:

While Pytube is a popular library for downloading YouTube videos, it has certain limitations due to the nature of YouTube's platform, policies, and changes over time. Understanding these limitations will help you manage your expectations when using Pytube for video downloads. Make sure to stay updated with the latest version of Pytube and exercise caution to comply with legal and ethical guidelines when downloading videos.

If you encounter any issues or limitations not covered in this README, refer to the Pytube documentation, GitHub repository, or seek assistance from the Pytube community for further guidance.
